# Leetspeak

Leetspeak (or l33tsp3@k) is a program that converts typed text into
[Leet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) in real-time. The application
captures keyboard input and automatically converts it to l33t using the selected
"language". This way, you can type anywhere while having the program run in
background. For in-game chatting, there is a hotkey to activate/deactivate live
conversion. So neither do you need a converter, nor are you required to possess
expert skills in leet-typing yourself. Some dictionaries, like "Handwriting"
can't be typed using a regular keyboard anyway. Additionally, there is a
converter for already existing text.
